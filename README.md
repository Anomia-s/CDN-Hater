# I-Hate-Media
A Discord bot that changes media with cdn url's for discord.

When you copy the link of an image or a video, discord will copy it to their `media.discord.net` domain, but this domain does not load videos or images properly.
This bot replaces the domains with `cdn.discord.com` for it to work properly.

Idea from a discord server for saucing mangas and memes, most of the times they have to ask the users to change their links.
